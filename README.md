# Internet-Security-Bypass-Proof-of-Concept
At the time of discovery, this PoC worked on all major Internet Security/AV vendors. Nevertheless, I submitted the report to only one of the vendors (with a none disclosure policy) on 08/10/2020 and the vulnerability has been mitigated. Also, the vulnerability was only tested on Windows 10 x64 machine.
